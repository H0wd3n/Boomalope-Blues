# Read me! Or Else...
- This is a modlist for Rimworld focused on performance and quality of life mods, No major content mods are added (sorry Combat Extended enjoyers) other than a few Vanilla Expanded mods that I feel compliment the Vanilla game well. Feel free to add/remove mods you like or dislike to the list but know that no support will be given if you do so. As for the specific settings for each mod, You can go through the mod options and tweak them how you want too. The default mod opitons shouldn't™ cause any problems.
- This list will be updated/edited when I have the time or when Rimworld gets a major update (if I remember)

# Mods you need to know about

- [Clean Textures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2865361569&searchtext=clea). Feel free to disable this mod at any time if you dislike the new textures for the dirt etc. It is just textures so it is save safe and can be removed at any time.
- [Cherry Picker](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3230046902). I highly recomend going to the Steam workshop page and reading what this mod does as it lets you remove certain parts of mods like new items or recipies that you do not want that is included in a mod.

# Mods you should avoid

- [Rimthreaded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222907981&searchtext=rimthreaded) This mod is a compatibility nightmare and in some cases make the game run even worse than vanilla.
- [EdB Prepare Carefully](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735106432&searchtext=prepare+carefully) I personally see this mod as cheating. But the more valid reason to not use this mod is that it's a VERY old mod with old code, it can cause game breaking errors late in the game and can even corrupt your save. If you have this mod enabled I HIGHLY reccomend disabling it and starting a new save without it. IF you really want a mod that does the same thing a good alternative is [Pawn Editor](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3219801790&searchtext=pawn+editor)
- [LWM's Deep Storage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896&searchtext=deep+storage) Some of the new storage buildings it adds that just stack a TON of items in the same place can cause Rimworld to freak out. [Adaptive Storage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3033901359&searchtext=adaptive+storage) is the better option now.
- You can refer to this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqoGCdgd_UQlrDRXmMn0j92FT2Qv3lcnlg1JyRow8Cg/edit#gid=1731985214) for a list of popular mods to check the performance impact of them.
## Do not go to any mod page this list includes asking for support for this list. Only go to the mod pages for support if a certain mod itself is causing errors/problems. They will (most likely) not help you with this list!

# Now read the [requirements](https://github.com/H0wd3n/Boomalope-Blues/blob/main/Requirements.md) and then head over to the [install instructions](https://github.com/H0wd3n/Boomalope-Blues/blob/main/Install-Instructions.md) to get started!
